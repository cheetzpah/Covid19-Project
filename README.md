# The Global Tapestry of COVID-19 Tapestry: Unraveling the Interplay of Vaccination, Lockdowns, and Socioeconomic Factors


Introduction: 
COVID-19 pandemic has intricately affected every aspect of our lives across continents. To fully comprehend this crisis, it is crucial to unravel the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus and its wide-ranging consequences. This project aims to decode patterns and connections, within the data by examining the relationship between vaccination rates, lockdown measures, socioeconomic factors, and mortality rates associated with COVID-19.
Additional Notes: This project was one of my individual endeavours aimed at gaining practical experience. I have utilized my growing expertise in data science and analysis. It provided me with an opportunity to apply all the concepts and topics I had studied so far in SQL and Tableau within a project.



Skills Used: 
•	Data cleaning and wrangling
•	SQL data manipulation 
•	Tableau data visualization
•	Data analysis and interpretation


Objective:
This project aims to answer the following questions:
1.	Identifying Countries with Extreme Death Counts and Vaccination Rates:
 a. Which countries have the highest and lowest total death counts from COVID-19?
 b. Which countries have the highest and lowest vaccination rates?
2.	Relationship between Vaccination Rates and COVID-19 Death Rates: How does vaccination rate correlate with COVID-19 death rates?
3.	Impact of Lockdown Stringency on COVID-19 Spread: How does the stringency of government lockdown measures affect the spread of COVID-19?
4.	Socio-economic Factors Associated with COVID-19 Death Rates: What are the socio-economic factors associated with higher COVID-19 death rates?
5.	Impact of Hospital Bed Availability on COVID-19 Mortality Rates: How does the availability of hospital beds affect COVID-19 mortality rates?
6.	Impact of Vaccination on COVID-19 Mortality Rates: How has vaccination affected COVID-19 mortality rates in different countries?



Data Source:
The data used for this project was obtained from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), covering the period from January 1, 2020, to September 13, 2023.


Methodology:
The project involved data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis using SQL and Tableau. SQL was used to create views and tables to organize and prepare the data for analysis. Tableau was used to create various visualizations to explore the relationships between different variables.



Conclusion:
The analysis revealed several key findings:
•	Countries with higher vaccination rates generally had lower COVID-19 death rates.
•	Stricter lockdown measures were associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases.
•	Socio-economic factors such as GDP per Capita, and cardiovascular death rates were correlated with COVID-19 death rates/
•	Countries with higher hospital bed availability had lower COVID-19 mortality rates.
•	Vaccination programs have led to significant reductions in COVID-19 mortality rates in many countries.


The vaccination campaigns have played a role, in reducing the mortality rates caused by COVID 19 in many countries. You can find the code for my project, on my GitHub repository cheetzpah/Covid19-Project (github.com), which showcases the work and expertise invested in this endeavour. The Tableau dashboard, filled with insights stands as evidence of the journey we embarked upon with a vision. Eventually gained a deep understanding of the global impact of the COVID 19 pandemic.
